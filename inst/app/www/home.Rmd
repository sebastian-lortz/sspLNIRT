### Sample Size Planning for Item Calibration with the Joint Hierarchical Model

`sspLNIRT` estimates the minimum sample size needed to achieve a desired accuracy of item parameter estimates under the Joint Hierarchical Model (JHM) of response accuracy and response time.

The JHM combines a 2-parameter normal ogive model for response accuracy with a 3-parameter log-normal model for response times, linked through higher-level joint distributions (see [van der Linden, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-006-1478-z); [Klein Entink et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-008-9075-y)).

### Precomputed Results

The **Precomputed** tab provides instant access to minimum sample sizes across **972 design conditions**. Select the input parameters of your planned study, e.g., test length, target item parameter, desired RMSE threshold, and the app retrieves the corresponding result from a precomputed database. **No simulations** are run. The output includes:

- **Minimum N** — the smallest sample size achieving the target RMSE, from a bisection search optimizer.
- **Power Curve N** — a smoothed estimate from a power-law curve fitted across all optimization steps, which reduces Monte Carlo variability.
- **Estimation at Minimum N** — RMSE, Monte Carlo SD, and bias for all item and person parameters at the minimum sample size.
- **Diagnostic plots** — parameter accuracy and bias (at minimum N) across true values, the power curve fitted to the optimization steps, and simulated response time and response accuracy distributions.

### Custom Optimization

The **Custom** tab allows running the sample size optimization for design conditions not covered by the precomputed grid. Specify custom item parameter means, covariance structures, residual variance settings, and other model parameters. Download the R script from the App and run it locally. The script calls `optim_sample()` and runs the full sample size estimation procedure, which requires substantial computation time.

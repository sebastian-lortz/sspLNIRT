### Sample Size Planning for Item Calibration with the Joint Hierarchical Model

`sspLNIRT` estimates the minimum sample size needed to achieve a desired precision of item parameter estimates under the Joint Hierarchical Model (JHM) of response accuracy and response time.

The JHM combines a 2-parameter normal ogive model for response accuracy with a 3-parameter log-normal model for response times, linked through higher-level joint distributions (see [van der Linden, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-006-1478-z); [Klein Entink et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-008-9075-y)). 

### Precomputed Results

The **Precomputed** tab provides instant access to minimum sample sizes across **972 design conditions**. Select the input parameters of your planned study, e.g., test length, target item parameter, desired RMSE threshold, and the app retrieves the corresponding result from a precomputed lookup database. No simulations are run.

The output includes:

- **Minimum N** — the smallest sample size achieving the target RMSE, from a bisection search optimizer.
- **Power Curve N** — a smoothed estimate from a power-law curve fitted across all optimization steps, which reduces Monte Carlo variability.
- **Precision summary** — RMSE, Monte Carlo SD, and bias for all item and person parameters at the minimum sample size.
- **Diagnostic plots** — parameter precision and bias across true values, the power curve of optimization steps, and simulated response time and response accuracy distributions.

### Custom Optimization

The **Custom** tab allows running the sample size optimization for design conditions not covered by the precomputed grid. Specify custom item parameter means, covariance structures, residual variance settings, and other model parameters. A R script can be downloaed and run locally. The optimization calls `optim_sample()` and runs the full optimization procedure, which requires substantial computation time.

More details regarding the `sspLNIRT` application in R can be found in this [tutorial](https://sebastian-lortz.github.io/sspLNIRT/articles/).
